## Current Priority

**RIGHT NOW:** Focus on Phase 2-3
1. Get server running locally
2. Test basic tool execution
3. Create initial skills
4. Verify Claude can use tools effectively

**NEXT:** Phase 4-5
1. Thorough testing with real data
2. Polish web interface
3. Make it daily-driver quality

**LATER:** Phases 6-8
1. Deploy to Proxmox
2. Production hardening
3. Security and reliability

## Testing Checklist for Each Phase

After completing each phase, verify:
- [ ] No Python errors/exceptions
- [ ] Server starts and responds
- [ ] Claude API calls work
- [ ] Tools execute correctly
- [ ] Web UI is usable
- [ ] Logs show expected behavior
- [ ] Can answer at least 3 different query types

## Notes

- Start simple: Get "search for term" working before complex org-ql
- Test incrementally: Don't write everything before testing
- Skills are easier to change than code: Prefer adding skills over code features
- Mobile testing early: Check responsive design frequently
- Security matters: Even in local dev, test command whitelist

## Success Criteria

**Phase 1-5 Complete When:**
- Can search notes from web UI on dev machine
- Can add content to journal
- Can run org-ql queries
- Conversation context works
- Mobile browser works well

**Ready for Deployment When:**
- All above plus production hardening
- Security measures in place
- Reliable error handling
- Good documentation

**Production Success When:**
- Daily use from mobile without friction
- More convenient than opening Emacs
- Becomes primary search interface
- Can trust it with important captures
